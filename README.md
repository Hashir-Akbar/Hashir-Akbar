# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hashir Akbar


I'm passionate about programming. I enjoy to write code it is like hobby to me. I am always learning new things everyday now it seems to become an addiction ðŸ‘€. I always thrive to write better code. I love to solve problems, Bugs fixing for most of people is like headache but for me that is a challenge to improve myself So, I like to solve programming problems on different websites like hacker rank and leet code. Nowdays, I am looking for a team/company/agency to work with that will help me improve myself by collaborating with senior members of my field. I am always ready to help my juniors. I am freindly you can contact me anytime for anything I will respond to you.
