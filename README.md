### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸš€

# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hashir Akbar

I am a passionate programmer who thrives on turning ideas into code. I enjoy diving deep into complex problems and constantly learning new technologies and techniques. Every day presents an opportunity for growth, and I eagerly embrace it. While I don't claim to be the best, my commitment to continuous improvement drives me to push my limits and strive for excellence in every project I undertake. My journey is one of relentless learning, persistence, and a deep love for coding.

- ðŸ”­ Perfection isn't the goal but being better is.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some nasty stuff.
- ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with companies/agencies/freelancers.
- âœ¨ Living inside the terminal.
- âš¡ Fun Fact: no fun, only code
- ðŸ“§ Keep moving and you'll find a way.
